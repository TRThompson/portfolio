	<h5>Chapter 1 - Computational Thinking<br><br></h5>
	
		KEY TERMS:<br>
		<b>Computational thinking: </b>A problem-solving approach that borrows techniques from computer science, notably abstraction,problem decomposition and the development of algorithms.Computational thinking is applied to a wide variety of problem domains and not just to the development of computer systems<br>
		<b>Decomposition:</b> The breaking down of a problem into smaller parts that are easier to solve. The smaller parts can sometimes be solved recursively (they can be run again and again until the problem is solved.<br>
		<b>Objects:</b> custom made data structures to represent real world entities<br>
		<b>Object-orientated programming:</b> A program made up of objects that interact - Java and C++<br>
		<b>Algorithm:</b> well defined series of steps that acts on some value or set of values as input and produces another value or set of values as output<br>
		<b>Recursion:</b> recursive algorithms break down a problem into smaller pieces which you either already know the answer to, or can solve by applying the same algorithm to each piece, and then combining the results.<br><br>
		
		KEY POINTS:<br>
		<li>Structured programming remains one of the key factors that affect the way in which your practical programming coursework is marked and judged</li>
		<li>Computer scientists have long learnt the power of decomposition to solve problems</li>
		<li>Many ways of decomposition have been developed - can be used to solve everyday problems</li>
		<li>Algorithms are an integral part of the decomposition process</li>
		<li>Small problems extracted from big problems should be solvable by an algorithm</li>
		<li>Recursive algorithms are particularly useful in solving simple repetitive problems that may have any number of iterations<br></li>
	
		<br><b>Computing people:</b><br>
			<b> 1. Seymour Papert </b><br>
				Seymour Papert was a south african (born American) mathematician, computer scientist and educator.
				He was part of artificial intelligence and co-invented the Logo programming language.
				Part of his career involved becoming a research associate at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
				in 1963 - 1967 which later led him to become a co-director of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. 
				During his time at MIT he developed the Logo programming language which was aimed at helping children think and solve problems. 
				The language that the children can use can also be used by experts at an advanced level.
				During his life he influenced many people and managed to win many awards including the Software Publishers Association Lifetime
				Achievement award in 1994 and being called ‘the greatest living mathematics educator’ by Marvin Minsky.<br><br>
		<b> 2.Jeanette Wing </b><br>
				Jeanette Wing is an American computer scientist who is corporate Vice Principal of Microsoft research which includes oversight of its
				core research labs around the world and Microsoft Research Connections. 
				Before 2013, she was the president’s professor of computer science at a university in the United States
				as well as having served as an assistant director for computer,information science and engineering at 
				the NSF from 2007 - 2010. She devoted a lot of time to the promotion of computational thinking and how
				it's a powerful approach to solving a variety of problems. She has been a leading member of the formal 
				methods community in the area of Larch which has lead to many research projects that are very widely 
				published. Larch is a family of formal specification languages that are intended for computing systems 
				which allow clean specification of computer programs and the formulations of proofs about program 
				behaviour. <br><br>
				
		<b>How computers help us think:</b><br>
			Changed the way we solve problems:
			<li>Technology can do all the hard work. We now approach problems differently in order to get the best out of a computer's power </li>
			<li> Formulating a problem for a computer solution clarifies our understanding of the problem as we realise it can be broken down into several simpler parts</li>
			<li> Understanding how computers store and process data provides us with powerful analogies for understanding how the world works.  </li>
