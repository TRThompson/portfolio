	<h5>Chapter 1 - Computational Thinking<br><br></h5>
	
		KEY TERMS:<br>
		<b>Computational thinking: </b>A problem-solving approach that borrows techniques from computer science, notably abstraction,problem decomposition and the development of algorithms.Computational thinking is applied to a wide variety of problem domains and not just to the development of computer systems<br>
		<b>Decomposition:</b> The breaking down of a problem into smaller parts that are easier to solve. The smaller parts can sometimes be solved recursively (they can be run again and again until the problem is solved.<br>
		<b>Objects:</b> custom made data structures to represent real world entities<br>
		<b>Object-orientated programming:</b> A program made up of objects that interact - Java and C++<br>
		<b>Algorithm:</b> well defined series of steps that acts on some value or set of values as input and produces another value or set of values as output<br><br>

		KEY POINTS:<br>
		<li>Structured programming remains one of the key factors that affect the way in which your practical programming coursework is marked and judged</li>
		<li>Computer scientists have long learnt the power of decomposition to solve problems</li>
		<li>Many ways of decomposition have been developed - can be used to solve everyday problems</li>
		<li>Algorithms are an integral part of the decomposition process</li>
		<li>Small problems extracted from big problems should be solvable by an algorithm</li>
		<li>Recursive algorithms are particularly useful in solving simple repetitive problems that may have any number of iterations<br></li>
