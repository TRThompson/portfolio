	<h5>Chapter 10 - Computer systems</h5>
	<p>
		KEY POINTS:<br>
		The CPU carries out all instructions in the computer<br>
		CPU is made of billions of transistors <br>
		Clock speed =  the operating speed of a computer or its microprocessor, expressed in cycles per second. Measured in gigahertz<br>
		Fetch - decode - execute cycle<br>

		CPU<br>
		Brain of the computer - carries out the instructions given to it <br>
		Inside a processor there is billions of transistors (electronic switches) that can be combined to build the circuitry inside a processor.<br>

		Moore’s Law: number of transistors on a processor would double approximately every 2 years<br>

		Gordon Moore is founder of intel (one of world’s best-known processor companies)<br>
		He predicted in 1965 the number of transistors on a processor would double approximately every 2 years - this has been true until recently when we are struggling with physical limits<br>
		Doubling the number of transistors in the same space increases speed of the processor - processor speed has increased exponentially (Smartphones today have faster processors than desktop computers 10 years ago) <br>

		Processor runs to the timings of a clock signal - clock speed is measured in hertz<br>
