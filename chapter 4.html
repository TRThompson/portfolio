		KEY TERMS:
<ul>
<li><b>BRA:</b> branch always. A Jump instruction that's always executed</li>
<li><b>BRP:</b>  Branch if the value in the accumulator is positive</li>
<li><b>Sequence:</b>  execution of statements/functions one after another - usually forms the bulk of the code in any program</li>
<li><b>Selection:</b>  the flow of the program is interrupted and control is passed onto another part of the program, the decision is based upon a boolean</li>
<li><b>Iteration:</b>  a section of code is repeated, based upon a boolean</li>
<li><b>Immutable:</b> Unchangeable. An entity that cannot be changed by the program</li>
<li><b>Source code: </b>The code that is written in the programming language. Software is open source if the source code is available</li>
<li><b>Build:</b> Refers to all the actions that a programmer takes to produce a finished working program </li>
</ul>

KEY POINTS:
<ul>
<li>All programs can be based on sequences, branches (selection) and iteration</li>
<li>Most programming languages have their own ways of enabling these constructs making them easier for the programmer</li>
<li>Selection is sometimes referred to as ‘branching’ and iteration means repetition of some of the process/code/program. </li>

<li>Variables can be altered during the running of a program</li>
<li>Variables have a data type that is usually fixed for the duration of the program</li>
<li>Variables are declared in advance in some languages but not in others</li>
<li>Variables can be global or local</li>
<li>Safer to use local variables where possible to avoid conflicts</li>
